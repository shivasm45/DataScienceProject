# NEOs Dataset (Prediction of NEO using Machine Learning Algorithm)

Title : PREDICTION OF POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS NEAREST EARTH OBJECTS (NEOs) USING MACHINE LEARNING

### The attributes of NASA NEO dataset are:
-> id : identifier (the same object can have several rows in the dataset, as it has been observed multiple times)

-> name : name given by NASA (including the year the asteroid was discovered)

-> est_diameter_min : minimum estimated diameter in kilometers

-> est_diameter_max : maximum estimated diameter in kilometers

-> relative_velocity : velocity relative to earth

-> miss_distance : distance in kilometers it misses Earth

-> orbiting_body : planet that the asteroid orbits

-> sentry_object : whether it is included in sentry - an automated collision monitoring system

-> absolute_magnitude : intrinsic luminosity

-> hazardous : whether the asteriod is potentially harmful or not
